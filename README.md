# SWStarter

## Running the app

- Create a file called `.env` at project's root folder. The required variables can be found at `src/Env.ts` (EnvScheme)
- Make sure you're using Node `lts/jod`. If you're using `nvm` you can run `nvm install` to set it up
- Install all dependencies by running `npm install`
- Not sure if your machine is ready to run the app? Run `npx expo-doctor` to check for potential issues
- Finally, run `npm run ios` or `npm run android` to run the app ðŸš€
